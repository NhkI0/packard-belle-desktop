================================================================
Engineering student | Angers, France | guengant.noe@gmail.com
================================================================
Likes to work with Python to do data Analysis and AI
Likes to have dumb side projects (the liberation of writing almost no tests!)
Likes to write efficient code and make fun things
Favorite of the teachers and of my mother (I'm the only child)
Looking for projects to collab on and doing stuff that matters
Loves english (990 out of 990 on TOEIC)
Mixed feelings about dutch (I WISH I COULD UNDERSTAND THIS NONSENSE)

===============
FORMATIONS (bit more serious)
===============
2022-2024: ESAIP, Engineering school -- St Barthélemy d'Anjou
In France, before attending an engineering diploma you need to spend 2 years in preparatory classes, this ensure you know all the bases you could ever need in sciences.
I got the chance to have all of my lectures in english and a mixed program with both informatics and environment studies. This is to my attention one if not the only mixed informatics/environment program that exist in France.

2024-Present: ESAIP, Engineering school -- St Barthélemy d'Anjou
I'm currently studying an Engineering diploma with a specialisation in AI and Data Analysis.
I learned:
- Machine Learning
- Optimisation Algorithm
- Probabilities
- Ethics of AI
- Image Analysis
- Data Engineering and Analysis

I also learned to work as a team, and so respectfully of others due to HR and teamwork we did.

===============
ABROAD EXPERIENCES
===============
June 2023: Rīgas Tehniskā universitāte (Riga Technical University) -- Riga, Latvia
I saw of to implement 5G networks and how to apply it to autonomous drones.

Summer semester 2024: VILNIUS TECH - Vilnius Gediminas Technical University -- Vilnius, Lithuania
I spent this semester practicing my english in my everyday life, it's also the moment where I started learning dutch thanks to a belgian friend there.
With the lectures I learned a lot about Java and Statistics which at the time was a great addition to my french program.

Summer semester 2025: Vysoká škola báňská - Technická univerzita Ostrava -- Ostrava, Czechia
It's the only ERASMUS I did where it was actually challenging, I loved learning "x86 assembly" and "image analysis" because it really felt like this could be of use later (I was so right with image analysis). 
It's also the first time I got long lasting project from the beginning to the end of the semester, I'm not sure this is the most effective way of working for me but I can't deny that learning by testing is the most satisfying thing. 

===============
WORK EXPERIENCE
===============
2023-2024: McDonald's -- Crewman
Because money isn't unlimited I worked at McDonald's on side of my studies, even though the timetable was 100% against the geneva convention it taught me some pretty valuable stuff. First of all teamwork under pressure, never had I experienced such pressure.
It also taught me that nothing is ever earned in this world and hard work is the key to everything. And to be honest I now know that I'll be the best in my field to avoid working in a chain ever again.

Summer 2025: Baker Tilly France -- Data architect internship
I joined a team that gave the mission to implement a full and comprehensive logging system to their pipeline. It was my first time ever joining a professional team and having to adapt to one.
I had to learn the tools they used, the specific process they used and also learn the proprietary code of their pipeline.
I'll be eternally grateful to my tutor for every tips he gave me, I learned so much about good practices in programming and about python with him. 
He was harsh and insufferable at every code review for my PRs, but this how I learned the most in all my life and this is also the way of working I'll adopt my whole life if I ever get to have trainees.
I learned "professional ways" of coding, and know that my ptyhon's code are now industry standards, and even though it is not yet at a senior's grade, I'm pretty sure I'll reach this soon enough.


===============
KEYWORDS I KNOW AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT AND WOULD TOUCH AGAIN
===============
Strong:
Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, AI,
SQL, PostgreSQL, JPQL,
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch basics,
Data Engineering, Image Analysis, Optimization Algorithms

Less strong but have used and enjoy a lot:
React (like this portfolio!), JavaScript, C/C++, Java,
Statistics, Probabilities, x86 Assembly (yes really),
HTML/CSS, Git, Linux/Unix

Not too keen on going near again:
Anything that makes me question the Geneva Convention

Stuff I'd like to do more of:
More complex AI projects, Deep Learning, NLP,
Backend development, DevOps, Open source contributions,
Projects that actually matter and help people

===============
ACHIEVEMENTS
===============
- 990/990 on TOEIC (English proficiency)
- Taught informatics to elders as a volunteer (great teacher you should definitely consider me!)
- Survived 3 ERASMUS exchanges (Latvia, Lithuania, Czechia)
- Learned x86 assembly and actually enjoyed it
- Successfully learning Dutch (still confused about de/het though)
- Funny enough (I hope)
